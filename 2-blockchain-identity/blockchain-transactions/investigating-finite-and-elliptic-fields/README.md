## Investigating Finite and Elliptic Fields

This project is not part of the official Udacity Blockchain Nanodegree
curriculum. I started this project to greater understand the math
behind blockchain security.

This project is written in Python (a language I don't use often) because
JavaScript doesn't deal well with modulo arithmetic on very large numbers.

```
# This will set everything up in Docker
sh docker_run.sh
# This will print out a bunch of interesting information about finite fields
# and will touch on the discrete logarithm problem, and Fermat's little
# theorem
python src/finite_fields.py
```

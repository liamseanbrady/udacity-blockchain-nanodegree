## Practice Hashing

This project consists of setting up the beginnings of a Block
in the blockchain in JS by giving a `Block` class a `generateHash`
method.

You can generate a hash using the `generateHash` method, by
doing the following in the terminal

```
# This will set everything up in Docker
sh docker_run.sh
# Generate a block and get its hash value (check src/app.js
for details)
node src/app.js
```

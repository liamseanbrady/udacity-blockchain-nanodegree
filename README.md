## Blockchain Work

This is the collection of my work produced whilst working through
Udacity's Blockchain Developer Nanodegree Program.

Most directories correspond to a particular
project, and each project directory contains a Dockerfile which
sets up the environment required to run the code, along with a
run_docker.sh file which gives you the command required to set
a working Docker container for that particular project. If you
have Docker installed on your machine you should be able to run
this bash script, and everything will work automagically. You can
run it with `sh run_docker.sh` as long as you're in the directory
where `run_docker.sh` lives. The `run_docker.sh` script builds the
required Docker image and then (in most cases) puts you inside a running container
based on that image (along with a command prompt).

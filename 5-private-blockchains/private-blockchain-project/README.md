## A simple private blockchain

This project encompasses a simple private blockchain. `src/simpleChain.js`
contains code which can be pasted into the console to first create a
bunch of blocks on the chain, and then to do operate on the chain with
functions to get a specific block, validate the chain, etc.

This is in no way intended to be 'production' grade. The intention of this
project is to greater understand the inner workings of blockchains, by
building a small, simple version of one.

```
# This will set everything up in Docker and open a bash shell to begin experimenting with the blockchain
sh docker_run.sh
```
